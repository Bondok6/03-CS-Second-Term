## Lecture 1

**What is inside a computer?**
- There are five classic components of a computer.
  1. Processor:
    * Divided into two groups:
      - Data section:
          * also called datapath.
          * contains the registers and the Arithmetic Logic unit.
          * is capable of performing certain operations on data items.
      - Control section:
          * the control unit that generates control signals that direct the operation of memory and datapath.
          * control signals do the following:
            - tell memory to send or receive data.
            - tell the ALU what operation to perform.
            - route data between different parts of the datapath.

  2. Registers:
    * the storage element for data inside the CPU.
    * hold temporary data during calculations.
    * faster in accessing than memory.

  3. Main Memory:
    * Large collection of circuits, each capable of storing a single bit.
